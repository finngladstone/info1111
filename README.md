Submission 1 is due Friday April 1: this involves

* Level 1: focused on basic technical skills (related to LateX and Git) and the types of skills used in different computing jobs.
* Level 2: focused on initial evaluation of the tech stack that is used by a selected company

Level 1 is 'compulsory', level 2 is optional

Note that:
* We have to submit the file as a rendered latex file:
* We each have to choose a subject from - Compsci, Soft Engineering, Datasci, Cybersec
* We are individually assessed (?), however there are some components besides the aforementioned subjects that we need to complete 

Project template has been added to the git, please allocate your topic

* Finn - Software Engineering
* Anh -
* Adam - Data Science
* Nam -

To edit the latex file, i've had to install a latex distro AND editor; I recommend you look online for each to find one that suits your purposes / OS
